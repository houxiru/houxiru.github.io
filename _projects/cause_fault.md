It’s widely thought that responsibility requires causation. This is codified in the law, and central to philosophical and psychological theories of causation and responsibility. But there are different kinds of causes. Some directly produce their effects, some do so indirectly and some, like absences, don’t produce them at all. Adults and children distinguish these kinds of causes and use different causal verbs to refer to them. Here we ask how children’s developing ability to distinguish these kinds of causes relates to their understanding of moral responsibility. We found in Experiment 1 that when Andy hits Suzy with his bike, she falls into a fence and it breaks, 3-year-old children understood “caused”, “break” and “fault” to refer to the proximal cause (e.g., Suzy). By 4, children understood these verbs to refer to different causes: Andy, the distal cause, “caused” the fence to break, it’s his “fault” that it broke, but Suzy, the proximal cause, “broke” it. In Experiment 2, we found that when Suzy let go of Andy’s safety rope, he slips while wall climbing, falls into a fan and the fan breaks, 3-year-olds understood “caused”, “break” and “fault” to refer to the direct cause Andy. Around 5 or 6, children understood these verbs to refer to different causes. Suzy, the absent cause, “caused” the fan to break, it’s her “fault” that it broke, but Andy, the direct cause, “broke” it. We discuss our findings in the context of an outcome to intention shift in children’s developing understanding of moral responsibility and suggest that there may be a more fundamental shift in children’s understanding of causation.

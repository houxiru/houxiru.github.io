Hello! I’m a computer science student at Stanford University with a deep passion for both artificial intelligence and computer graphics. My academic and research experiences have spanned from building deep learning models for computer vision and natural language processing to exploring novel applications of graph neural networks. I’ve also delved into the exciting realm of VR development, where I combine immersive technologies with creative design to push the boundaries of interactive experiences. 

In addition to my technical pursuits, I actively engage in interdisciplinary research within Stanford's cognitive science labs, exploring developmental cognition and causality. This work includes co-authoring research papers on moral reasoning and causation, alongside engineering studies for large-scale data collection.
